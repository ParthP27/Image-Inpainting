# Image-Inpainting
- Inpainting is the process of reconstructing lost or deteriorated parts of images and videos.
- Image inpainting aims to fill missing regions of a damaged image with possibly synthesized content.

# Generative Adversarial Network
- Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs are a deep-learning-based generative model that is used for Unsupervised Learning.
- Most of the GANs today in existence use DCGAN architecture.
